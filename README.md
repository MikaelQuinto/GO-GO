## Part I
- To get started with Go, we need to begin with the basics.
``` GO
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```
For basic variables, the following should be remembered:
- **int**: Stores integers (whole numbers), such as 123 or -123.
- **float32**: Stores floating-point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99.
- **string**: Stores text, such as "Hello World." String values are enclosed in double quotes.
- **bool**: Stores values with two states: true or false.

There are two ways to create variables.
- var _______ -type-
- var _______ -type- = _______
- _______ := _______
